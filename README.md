# Session
So that all requests can be assigned correctly to each user, a session is created. The session is 36 characters long and is structured as follows:

| Random (8)  | - | Random (4) | - | Random (4) | - | Random (4) | - | Random (12) |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| b842fedc  | - | f4f4 | - | 4661 | - | a886 | - | ee427982ae78 |
```
b842fedc-f4f4-4661-a886-ee427982ae78
```
