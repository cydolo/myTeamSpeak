# Own Badges
To get your own badges, TeamSpeak sends a POST request to:
```
POST: https://clientapi.myteamspeak.com/user
```
The request-body consists of the method "getBadges" and the session

| Method  | character | Session |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| getBadges | $ | 0a3eaf06-e59b-411d-89d1-cf475a249fd4  |
```
getBadges$0a3eaf06-e59b-411d-89d1-cf475a249fd4
```
We receive a protobuf with our available badges
```
